# ⚡ EV Charging Demand Forecasting

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand using synthetic dataset values.  
The goal is to analyze historical energy usage patterns and predict future electricity requirements for EV charging stations.  
By applying data preprocessing and time series forecasting (Exponential Smoothing), this project provides actionable insights for optimizing charging station operations.

## 🧠 Steps Involved in Building the Project
1. **Data Loading:** Imported and explored the dataset for key features such as connection time, day indicator, and kWh delivered.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Created a timestamp column using `dayIndicator` and `connectionTime_decimal`.  
3. **Aggregation:** Grouped data by day to calculate total energy delivered (kWh per day).  
4. **Modeling:** Applied the **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)** forecasting method to predict future demand.  
5. **Visualization:** Generated clear line charts showing daily demand and 7-day forecast.  
6. **Report Generation:** Compiled findings, plots, and conclusions into a professional 2-page PDF report.
